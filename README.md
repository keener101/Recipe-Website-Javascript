# Recipe-Website-Javascript

Recipe Website using JavaScript (ES6+) created as final project in online course. Instructor provided starter files with HTML and CSS. All Javascript was done by me, with the help of course material. Course: https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-javascript-course/learn/v4/overview

Known bugs:

- Some recipes do not load. Unknown why.
- Under some states, clicking on a favorited recipe does not load the recipe. Refreshing the browser fixes this
- Some ingredients use large numbers as fractions (i.e, 333333333333/ 10000000000). This is because the api is providing a strange format for some numbers.
